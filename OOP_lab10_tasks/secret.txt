In a quiet village, Arman found an old lamp in his grandmother's attic.
He rubbed it, and a tiny, tired genie appeared, offering one wish.
Arman wished to talk to animalsâ€”and suddenly, they spoke back.
The creatures became his friends and taught him nature's secrets.
One day, they warned him of a storm, and he saved the village.
No one knew how he knew, but the genie just snored on in his lamp.
